A cute little moon rabbit is just too happy to eat his rice cakes! BOING, oh no
there he goes. Our little moon rabbit has jumped into space! Help him land on
the moon safely and not crash land.

### About this game
In this game, you will be controlling a platform to stop a little moon rabbit
from falling and crash landing into the moon.

Players can move with the arrow keys, but they will not be able to go above
half way up the screen.

The rabbit will be bouncing around the screen. It will collide and bounce
off the edges and off the platform the player controls. The player will lose if
the rabbit falls onto the moon and crash lands. The player will win when they
have bounced the rabbit enough times. However, the number of times to win will
be random each time they play the game.

Sometimes power-ups will spawn (max of 3 on the screen). If the rabbit comes
into contact with these power ups its speed will double. These power ups will
be able to stack.

### Controls
* Movement: WASD
* Return to title screen: Tab
* Proceed: Z
